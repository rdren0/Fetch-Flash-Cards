# Memoize, a flash card App to learn about Fetch
### By Rachael Drenann

## To begin:
In your terminal:

```bash
npm  install
```

```bash
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to view the code running in the browser.


This was a solo project where we needed to use react, JSX, Sass/Scss, local storage, and Enzyme/Jest to demonstrate our mastery and understanding of the framework React

## What I gained from this project
In making this site, I gained a much better understanding on testing specifically. I learned what needs to be tested and how to ensure your app is working as you would expect.
### Examples
## Favoriting a card and refreshing the page to check persistence:

## Toggling through each category:

## What you see once you complete all cards, requirement changed to 3 cards for this example:
